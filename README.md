Manim animations and code for my math assignment.


---------------------------------------------------------------
Math Assignment – Polar Curves and Arc Length
This repository contains the Manim animations, code, and supporting files used to visualize problems from my mathematics assignment. The aim is to present mathematical concepts—especially polar curves and arc length—in a clear and dynamic way.
Contents
Manim source code (.py files)
Rendered animation videos (.mp4)
Screenshots and supporting assets used in the final assignment PDF
Included Visualizations
Cardioid–Limaçon intersection animation
Arc length of the lemniscate r^2= 4cos(2θ)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Technologies Used: 
Manim Community Edition
Python 3
NumPy
Running the Code
To render any animation locally:
manim -pqh filename.py ClassName
Example:
manim -pqh animated_lima_cardioid_area.py CardioidLimaconIntersection
Academic Purpose
This repository was created for academic submission.
The animations provide clearer visual understanding than static diagrams alone.
